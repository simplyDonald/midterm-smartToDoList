## Smart To Do List

When you are recommended something it's not always easy to jot it down for later in an organized fashion. Adding the item to your phone or computer ends up taking time and opening up the right app is only part of the problem. You then have to locate the right list ("Movies to watch", "Books to read", etc.) to add to and when you get to it you don't have much more context so there's not much you can do about the phrase. This delay and lack of additional information acts as a huge deterrent.

The solution? A smart, auto-categorizing todo list app. The user simply has to add the name of the thing, and it gets put into the correct list.

Project Requirements:
Each todo created should be categorized as one of:

Film / Series (To watch)
Restaurants, cafes, etc. (To eat)
Books (To read)
Products (To buy)
Others (misc)
In order to determine the category the app will probably need to use various API services such as those offered by Google, Wolfram Alpha, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, Yelp and others.

Users should be able to change a category of an item in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.

Users should be able to register, log in, log out and update their profile.
